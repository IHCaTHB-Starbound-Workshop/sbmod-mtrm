        "Excited. There are so many tissue samples for me to examine!",
        "Cheerful. This suit doesn't actually help much against the harsh radioactivity, I just feel safer with it on!",
        "Excited. There are a lot of hostile creatures in the area. Fascinating!",
        "Excited. This planet is utterly unsafe. I love it!",
        "Curious. I wonder what new medicines we could create using samples from this planet?",
        "Boastful. My fellow scientists and I are setting out to investigate all the alien planets in the universe!",
        "Curious. I wonder if the radioactivity has catalysed unstable growth on this planet?",
        "Irritated. I'm doing some research. Don't contaminate my samples!",
        "Troubled. \"Let's do some research on a dangerous alien planet\", they said! \"What could go wrong?\" they said!",
        "Excited. Learning is cool, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!",
        "Thoughtful. They could really make these suits a little friendlier, couldn't they?",
        "Curious. Can you see my face through this suit?",
        "Alarmed. Don't touch me - I'm covered in unidentified microorganisms!",
        "Proud. Beneath this yellow suit, my gears clank for the love of discovery!",
        "Thoughtful. Even if all culture was somehow lost, people would still eventually rediscover science."
